Unit testing and refactoring
============================

The ideas explored in this chapter are fundamental pillars because of their importance towards our ultimate
goal: to write better and more maintainable software.

Unit tests (and any form of automatic tests, for that matter) are critical to software
maintainability, and therefore are something that cannot be missing from any quality
project. It is for that reason that this chapter is dedicated exclusively to aspects of
automated testing as a key strategy, to safely modify the code, and iterate over it, in
incrementally better versions.
