Documenting your project
========================

Documentation is the work that is often neglected by developers and their managers. This
is often due to lack of time toward the end of development cycles, and the fact that people
think they are bad at writing. Even though some developers may not be very good
at writing, the majority of them should be able to produce fine documentation.

The common result of neglecting the documentation efforts is a disorganized
documentation landscape that is made up of documents written in a rush. Developers often
hate doing this kind of work. Things get even worse when the existing documents need to
be updated. Many projects out there are just providing poor, out of date documentation
because no one in their team knows how to properly deal with it.

But setting up a documentation process at the beginning of the project and treating
documents as if they were modules of code makes documenting easier. Writing can even be
fun if you start following a few simple rules.

.. include:: rules.rst
.. include:: documentation_as_code.rst
.. include:: documentation_generators.rst
.. include:: web_apis.rst
.. include:: organization.rst
