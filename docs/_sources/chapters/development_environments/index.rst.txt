Modern Python Development Environments
======================================

A deep understanding of the programming language of choice is the most important thing
in being an expert. This will always be true for any technology. Still, it is really hard to
develop good software without knowing the common tools and practices that are common
within the given language community. Python has no single feature that cannot be found in
some other language. So, in direct comparison of syntax, expressiveness, or performance,
there will always be a solution that is better in one or more fields. But, the area in which
Python really stands out from the crowd is the whole ecosystem built around the language.
The Python community spent years polishing standard practices and libraries that help to
create more reliable software in a shorter time.

The most obvious and important part of the ecosystem is a huge collection of free and open
source packages that solve a multitude of problems. Writing new software is always an
expensive and time-consuming process. Being able to reuse the existing code instead
of reinventing the wheel greatly reduces development times and costs. For some companies,
it is the only reason why their projects are economically feasible.

Because of this, Python developers put a lot of effort into creating tools and standards to
work with open source packages that have been created by others: starting from virtual
isolated environments, improved interactive shells, and debuggers, to programs that help
to discover, search, and analyze the huge collection of packages that are available
on Python Package Index (PyPI).
