Docker
======

First, we run the app with an interactive terminal as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -ti repo.gradiant.org:9008/clean_code

This will let you execute some commands in the running Docker container. This terminal will already have the conda
environment activated and will be inside the project's root. In this interactive terminal you will be able to run the
examples showed in this documentation.
