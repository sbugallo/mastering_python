<h1>Modern Python Development Environments<a class="headerlink" href="#modern-python-development-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A deep understanding of the programming language of choice is the most important thing
in being an expert. This will always be true for any technology. Still, it is really hard to
develop good software without knowing the common tools and practices that are common
within the given language community. Python has no single feature that cannot be found in
some other language. So, in direct comparison of syntax, expressiveness, or performance,
there will always be a solution that is better in one or more fields. But, the area in which
Python really stands out from the crowd is the whole ecosystem built around the language.
The Python community spent years polishing standard practices and libraries that help to
create more reliable software in a shorter time.</p>
<p>The most obvious and important part of the ecosystem is a huge collection of free and open
source packages that solve a multitude of problems. Writing new software is always an
expensive and time-consuming process. Being able to reuse the existing code instead
of reinventing the wheel greatly reduces development times and costs. For some companies,
it is the only reason why their projects are economically feasible.</p>
<p>Because of this, Python developers put a lot of effort into creating tools and standards to
work with open source packages that have been created by others: starting from virtual
isolated environments, improved interactive shells, and debuggers, to programs that help
to discover, search, and analyze the huge collection of packages that are available
on Python Package Index (PyPI).</p>
<div class="section" id="installing-packages-with-pip">
<h2>1. Installing packages with pip<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-packages-with-pip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Nowadays, a lot of operating systems come with Python as a standard component. Most
Linux distributions and UNIX-based systems, such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, or
macOS, come with Python either installed by default or available through system package
repositories. Many of them even use it as part of some core components: Python powers
the installers of Ubuntu (Ubiquity), Red Hat Linux (Anaconda), and Fedora (Anaconda
again). Unfortunately, the preinstalled system version of Python is often Python 2.7, which
is fairly outdated.</p>
<p>Due to Python’s popularity as an operating system component, a lot of packages from PyPI
are also available as native packages managed by the system’s package management tools,
such as apt-get (Debian, Ubuntu), rpm (Red Hat Linux), or emerge (Gentoo). It should be
remembered, however, that the list of available libraries is very limited, and they are mostly
outdated compared to PyPI. This is the reason why pip should always be used to obtain
new packages in the latest version, as recommended by the Python Packaging Authority
(PyPA). Although it is an independent package, starting from version 2.7.9 and 3.4 of
CPython, it is bundled with every new release by default. Installing the new package is as
simple as this:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install &lt;package-name&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Among other features, pip allows specific versions of packages to be forced (using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span>
<span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">package-name==version</span></code> syntax) and upgraded to the latest version available
(using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--upgrade</span></code> switch). The full usage description for most of the command-line
tools presented in the book can be easily obtained simply by running the command with
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-h</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--help</span></code> switch, but here is an example session that demonstrates the most
commonly used options:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ pip show pip

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span></code> may be used to install system-wide packages. On UNIX-based and Linux systems, this
will require superuser privileges, so the actual invocation will be as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo pip install &lt;package-name&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that this is not required on Windows since it does not provide the Python interpreter
by default, and Python on Windows is usually installed manually by the user without
superuser privileges.</p>
<p>Installing system-wide packages directly from PyPI is not recommended, and should be
avoided. This may seem like a contradiction to the previous statement that using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span></code> is a
PyPA recommendation, but there are some serious reasons for that. As we explained
earlier, Python is often an important part of many packages that are available through
operating system package repositories, and may power a lot of important services. System
distribution maintainers put in a lot of effort to select the correct versions of packages to
match various package dependencies. Very often, Python packages that are available from
a system’s package repositories contain custom patches, or are purposely kept outdated to
ensure compatibility with some other system components. Forcing an update of such a
package, using pip, to a version that breaks some backward compatibility, might cause
bugs in some crucial system service.</p>
<p>Doing such things on the local computer for development purposes only is also not a good
excuse. Recklessly using pip that way is almost always asking for trouble, and will
eventually lead to issues that are very hard to debug. This does not mean that installing
packages from PyPI is a strictly forbidden thing, but it should be always done
consciously and with an understanding of the related risk.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is an easy solution to this problem: environment isolation. There are
various tools that allow the isolation of the Python runtime environment at different levels
of system abstraction. The main idea is to isolate project dependencies from packages that
are required by different projects and/or system services. The benefits of this approach are
as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It solves the Project X depends on version 1.x but, Project Y needs 4.x dilemma. The developer can work on multiple projects with different dependencies that may even collide without the risk of affecting each other.</p></li>
<li><p>The project is no longer constrained by versions of packages that are provided in the developer’s system distribution repositories.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no risk of breaking other system services that depend on certain package versions, because new package versions are only available inside such an environment.</p></li>
<li><p>A list of packages that are project dependencies can be easily frozen, so it is very easy to reproduce such an environment on another computer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re working on multiple projects in parallel, you’ll quickly find that is impossible to
maintain their dependencies without any kind of isolation.</p>
<div class="section" id="application-level-isolation-versus-system-level-isolation">
<h3>2.1 Application-level isolation versus system-level isolation<a class="headerlink" href="#application-level-isolation-versus-system-level-isolation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The easiest and most lightweight approach to isolation is to use application-level virtual
environments. These focus on isolating the Python interpreter and the packages available
within it. Such environments are very easy to set up, and are very often just enough to
ensure proper isolation during the development of small projects and packages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in some cases, this may not be enough to ensure enough consistency and
reproducibility. Despite the fact that software written in Python is usually considered very
portable, it is still very easy to run into issues that occur only on selected systems or even
specific distributions of such systems (for example, Ubuntu versus Gentoo). This is very
common in large and complex projects, especially if they depend on compiled Python
extensions or internal components of the hosting operating system.</p>
<p>In such cases, system-level isolation is a good addition to the workflow. This kind of
approach usually tries to replicate and isolate complete operating systems with all of its
libraries and crucial system components, either with classical system virtualization tools
(for example, VMWare, Parallels, and VirtualBox) or container systems (for example,
Docker and Rocket).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-s-venv">
<h3>2.2. Python’s venv<a class="headerlink" href="#python-s-venv" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are several ways to isolate Python at runtime. The simplest and most obvious,
although hardest to maintain, is to manually change the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PATH</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PYTHONPATH</span></code>
environment variables and/or move the Python binary to a different, customized place
where we want to store our project’s dependencies, in order to affect the way that it
discovers available packages. Fortunately, there are several tools available that can help in
maintaining the virtual environments and packages that are installed for these
environments. These are mainly <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">venv</span></code>. What they do under the hood is, in
fact, the same that we would do manually. The actual strategy depends on the specific tool
implementation, but generally they are more convenient to use and can provide additional
benefits.</p>
<p>To create new virtual environment, you can simply use the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python3.7 -m venv ENV
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ENV</span></code> should be replaced by the desired name for the new environment. This will
create a new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ENV</span></code> directory in the current working directory path. Inside, it will contain a
few new directories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bin/</span></code>: This is where the new Python executable and scripts/executables provided by other packages are stored.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lib/</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">include/</span></code>: These directories contain the supporting library files for new Python inside the virtual environment. The new packages will be installed in ENV/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the new environment has been created, it needs to be activated in the current shell
session using UNIX’s source command: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">source</span> <span class="pre">ENV/bin/activate</span></code></p>
<p>This changes the state of the current shell sessions by affecting its environment variables. In
order to make the user aware that they have activated the virtual environment, it will
change the shell prompt by appending the (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ENV</span></code>) string at its beginning. To illustrate this,
here is an example session that creates a new environment and activates it:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python -m venv example
$ <span class="nb">source</span> example/bin/activate
<span class="o">(</span>example<span class="o">)</span> $ which python
/home/swistakm/example/bin/python
<span class="o">(</span>example<span class="o">)</span> $ deactivate
$ which python
/usr/local/bin/python
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The important thing to note about <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">venv</span></code> is that it depends completely on its state, as stored
on a filesystem. It does not provide any additional abilities to track what packages should
be installed in it. These virtual environments are also not portable, and should not be
moved to another system/machine. This means that the new virtual environment needs to
be created from scratch for each new application deployment. Because of this, there is a
good practice that’s used by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">venv</span></code> users to store all project dependencies in
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requirements.txt</span></code> file (this is the naming convention), as shown in the following
code:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># lines followed by hash (#) are treated as a comments</span>
<span class="c1"># strict version names are best for reproducibility</span>
<span class="n">eventlet</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">0.17</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">graceful</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">0.1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="c1"># for projects that are well tested with different</span>
<span class="c1"># dependency versions the relative version specifiers</span>
<span class="c1"># are acceptable too</span>
<span class="n">falcon</span><span class="o">&gt;=</span><span class="mf">0.3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="c1"># packages without versions should be avoided unless</span>
<span class="c1"># latest release is always required/desired</span>
<span class="n">pytz</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With such files, all dependencies can be easily installed using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span></code>, because it accepts the
requirements file as its output: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">-r</span> <span class="pre">requirements.txt</span></code></p>
<p>What needs to be remembered is that the requirements file is not always the ideal solution,
because it does not define the exact list of dependencies, only those that are to be installed.
So, the whole project can work without problems in some development environments but
will fail to start in others if the requirements file is outdated and does not reflect the actual
state of the environment. There is, of course, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">freeze</span></code> command, which prints all
packages in the current environment, but it should not be used blindly. It will output
everything, even packages that are not used in the project but are installed only for testing.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>For Windows users, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">venv</span></code> under Windows uses a different naming
convention for its internal structure of directories. You need to
use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Scripts/</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Libs/</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Include/</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bin/</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lib/</span></code>,
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">include/</span></code>, to better match development conventions on that
operating system. The commands that are used for activating/deactivating
the environment are also different; you need to
use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ENV/Scripts/activate.bat</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ENV/Scripts/deactivate.bat</span></code>
instead of using source on activate and deactivate scripts.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>The Python <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">venv</span></code> module provides an additional <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvenv</span></code> command-line

officially discouraged, as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pythonX.Y</span> <span class="pre">-m</span> <span class="pre">venv</span></code> command is explicit

<p>In most cases, software implementation can iterate quickly because developers reuse a lot
of existing components. Don’t Repeat Yourself: this is a popular rule and motto of many
programmers. Using other packages and modules to include them in the code base is only a
part of that culture. What can also be considered under reused components are binary
libraries, databases, system services, third-party APIs, and so on. Even whole operating
systems should be considered as being reused.</p>
<p>The backend services of web-based applications are a great example of how complex such
applications can be. The simplest software stack usually consists of a few layers (starting
from the lowest):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A database or other kind of storage</p></li>
<li><p>The application code implemented in Python</p></li>
<li><p>An HTTP server, such as Apache or NGINX</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, such stacks can be even simpler, but it is very unlikely. In fact, big applications
are often so complex that it is hard to distinguish single layers. Big applications can use
many different databases, be divided into multiple independent processes, and use many
other system services for caching, queuing, logging, service discovery, and so on. Sadly,
there are no limits for complexity, and it seems that code simply follows the second law of
thermodynamics.</p>
<p>What is really important is that not all software stack elements can be isolated on the level
of Python runtime environments. No matter whether it is an HTTP server, such as Nginx,
or RDBMS, such as PostgreSQL, they are usually available in different versions on different
systems. Making sure that everyone in a development team uses the same versions of every
component is very hard without the proper tools. It is theoretically possible that all
developers in a team working on a single project will be able to get the same versions of
services on their development boxes. But all this effort is futile if they do not use the same
operating system as they do in the production environment. Forcing a programmer to work
on something else rather than their beloved system of choice is impossible.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that portability is still a big challenge. Not all services will work
exactly the same in production environments as they do on the developer’s machines, and
this is very unlikely to change. Even Python can behave differently on different systems,
despite how much work is put in to make it cross-platform. Usually, this is well
documented and happens only in places that depend directly on system calls, but relying
on the programmer’s ability to remember a long list of compatibility quirks is quite an
error-prone strategy.</p>
<p>A popular solution to this problem is isolating whole systems as an application
environment. This is usually achieved by leveraging different types of system virtualization
tools. Virtualization, of course, reduces performance; but with modern computers that have
hardware support for virtualization, the performance loss is usually negligible. On the
other hand, the list of possible gains is very long:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The development environment can exactly match the system version and services used in production, which helps to solve compatibility issues</p></li>
<li><p>Definitions for system configuration tools, such as Puppet, Chef, or Ansible (if used), can be reused to configure the development environment</p></li>
<li><p>The newly hired team members can easily hop into the project if the creation of such environments is automated</p></li>
<li><p>The developers can work directly with low-level system features that may not be available on operating systems they use for work, for example, File System in User Space (FUSE), which is not available in Windows.</p></li>

<h4>2.3.1. Virtual development environments using Vagrant<a class="headerlink" href="#virtual-development-environments-using-vagrant" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Vagrant currently seems to be one of the most popular tools for developers to manage
virtual machines for the purpose of local development. It provides a simple and convenient
way to describe development environments with all system dependencies in a way that
is directly tied to the source code of your project. It is available for Windows, Mac OS, and a
few popular Linux distributions (refer to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vagrantup.com">https://www.vagrantup.com</a>). It does not have
any additional dependencies. Vagrant creates new development environments in the form
of virtual machines or containers. The exact implementation depends on a choice of
virtualization providers. VirtualBox is the default provider, and it is bundled with the
Vagrant installer, but additional providers are available as well. The most notable choices
are VMware, Docker, Linux Containers (LXC), and Hyper-V.</p>
<p>The most important configuration is provided to Vagrant in a single file
named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Vagrantfile</span></code>. It should be independent for every project. The following are the
most important things it provides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Choice of virtualization provider</p></li>
<li><p>A box, which is used as a virtual machine image</p></li>
<li><p>Choice of provisioning method</p></li>
<li><p>Shared storage between the VM and VM’s host</p></li>
<li><p>Ports that need to be forwarded between VM and its host</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The syntax language for Vagrantfile is Ruby. The example configuration file provides a
good template to start the project and has an excellent documentation, so the knowledge of
this language is not required. Template configuration can be created using a single
command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>vagrant init
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will create a new file named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Vagrantfile</span></code> in the current working directory. The best
place to store this file is usually the root of the related project sources. This file is already a
valid configuration that will create a new VM using the default provider and base box
image. The default <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Vagrantfile</span></code> content that’s created with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vagrant</span> <span class="pre">init</span></code> command
contains a lot of comments that will guide you through the complete configuration process.</p>
<p>The following is a minimal example of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Vagrantfile</span></code> for the Python 3.7 development
environment based on the Ubuntu operating system, with some sensible defaults that,
among others, enable port 80 forwarding in case you want to do some web development
with Python:</p>

<span class="sh"> apt-get install python3.7 -y</span>
<span class="dl"> SHELL</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the preceding example, we have set an additional provision of system packages with
simple shell script. When you feel that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Vagrantfile</span></code> is ready, you can run your virtual
machine using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>vagrant up
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The initial start can take a few minutes, because the actual box image must be downloaded
from the web. There are also some initialization processes that may take a while every time
the existing VM is brought up, and the amount of time depends on the choice of provider,
image, and your system’s performance. Usually, this takes only a couple of seconds. Once
the new Vagrant environment is up and running, developers can connect to it through SSH
using the following shorthand:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>vagrant ssh
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This can be done anywhere in the project source tree below the location of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Vagrantfile</span></code>.
For the developers’ convenience, Vagrant will traverse all directories above the user’s
current working directory in the filesystem tree, looking for the configuration file and
matching it with the related VM instance. Then, it establishes the secure shell connection, so
the development environment can be interacted with just like an ordinary remote machine.
The only difference is that the whole project source tree (root defined as the location
of Vagrantfile) is available on the VM’s filesystem under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/vagrant/</span></code>. This directory is
automatically synchronized with your host filesystem, so you can normally work in the IDE
or editor of your choice run on the host, and can treat the SSH session to your Vagrant VM
just like a normal local Terminal session.</p>

<h4>2.3.2. Virtual environments using Docker<a class="headerlink" href="#virtual-environments-using-docker" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Containers are an alternative to full machine virtualization. It is a lightweight method of
virtualization, where the kernel and operating system allow multiple isolated user space
instances to be run. OS is shared between containers and the host, so it theoretically
requires less overhead than in full virtualization. Such a container contains only application
code and its system-level dependencies, but, from the perspective of processes running
inside, it looks like a completely isolated system environment.</p>
<p>Software containers got their popularity mostly thanks to Docker, which is one of the
available implementations. Docker allows to describe its container in the form of a simple
text document called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dockerfile</span></code>. Containers from such definitions can be built and
stored. It also supports incremental changes, so if new things are added to the container
then it does not need to be recreated from scratch.</p>
<div class="section" id="containerization-versus-virtualization">
<h5>2.3.2.1. Containerization versus virtualization<a class="headerlink" href="#containerization-versus-virtualization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Different tools, such as Docker and Vagrant, seem to overlap in features: but the main
difference between them is the reason why these tools were built. Vagrant, as we
mentioned earlier, is built primarily as a tool for development. It allows us to bootstrap the
whole virtual machine with a single command, but does not allow us to simply pack such
an environment as a complete deliverable artifact and deploy or release it. Docker, on the
other hand, is built exactly for that purpose: preparing complete containers that can be
sent and deployed to production as a whole package. If implemented well, this can greatly
improve the process of product deployment. Because of that, using Docker and similar
solutions (Rocket for example) during development only makes more sense if such
containers are also to be used in the deployment process on production.</p>
<p>Due to some implementation nuances, the environments that are based on containers may
sometimes behave differently than environments based on virtual machines. If you decide
to use containers for development, but don’t decide to use them on target production
environments, you’ll lose some of the consistency guarantees that were the main reason for
environment isolation. But, if you already use containers in your target production
environments, then you should always replicate production conditions rather than using
the same technique. Fortunately, Docker, which is currently the most popular container
solution, provides an amazing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docker-compose</span></code> tool that makes the management of local
containerized environments extremely easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-your-first-dockerfile">
<h5>2.3.2.2. Writing your first Dockerfile<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-your-first-dockerfile" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Every Docker-based environment starts with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dockerfile</span></code>. Dockerfile is a format description
of how to create a Docker image. You can think about the Docker images in a similar way to
how you would think about images of virtual machines. It is a single file (composed of
many layers) that encapsulates all system libraries, files, source code, and other
dependencies that are required to execute your application.</p>
<p>Every layer of a Docker image is described in the Dockerfile by a single instruction in the
following format: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INSTRUCTION</span> <span class="pre">arguments</span></code>.</p>
<p>Docker supports plenty of instructions, but the most basic ones that you need to know in
order to get started are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FROM</span> <span class="pre">&lt;image-name&gt;</span></code>: This describes the base image that your image will be based on.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">COPY</span> <span class="pre">&lt;src&gt;...</span> <span class="pre">&lt;dst&gt;</span></code>: This copies files from the local build context (usually project files) and adds them to the container’s filesystem.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ADD</span> <span class="pre">&lt;src&gt;...</span> <span class="pre">&lt;dst&gt;</span></code>: This works similarly to COPY but automatically unpacks archives and allows &lt;src&gt; to be URLs.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RUN</span> <span class="pre">&lt;command&gt;</span></code>: This runs specified commands on top of previous layers, and commits changes that this command made to the filesystem as a new image layer.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ENTRYPOINT</span> <span class="pre">[&quot;&lt;executable&gt;&quot;,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;&lt;param&gt;&quot;,</span> <span class="pre">...]</span></code>: This configures the default command to be run as your container. If no entry point is specified anywhere in the image layers, then Docker defaults to /bin/sh -c.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CMD</span> <span class="pre">[&quot;&lt;param&gt;&quot;,</span> <span class="pre">...]</span></code>: This specifies the default parameters for image entry points. Knowing that the default entry point for Docker is /bin/sh -c, this instruction can also take the form of CMD [“&lt;executable&gt;”, “&lt;param&gt;”, …], although it is recommended to define the target executable directly in the ENTRYPOINT instruction and use CMD only for default arguments.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WORKDIR</span> <span class="pre">&lt;dir&gt;</span></code>: This sets the current working directory for any of the following RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To properly illustrate the typical structure of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dockerfile</span></code>, let’s assume that we want to
dockerize the built-in Python web server available through the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http.server</span></code> module with
some predefined static files that this server should serve. The structure of our project files
could be as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>.
├── Dockerfile
├── README
└── static
    ├── index.html
    └── picture.jpg
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Locally, you could run that Python’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http.server</span></code> on a default HTTP port with the
following simple command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">python3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">7</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">directory</span> <span class="n">static</span><span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">80</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This example is of course, very trivial, and using Docker for it is using a sledgehammer to
crack a nut. So, just for the purpose of this example, let’s pretend that we have a lot of code
in the project that generates these static files. We would like to deliver only these static files,
and not the code that generates them. Let’s also assume that the recipients of our image
know how to use Docker but don’t know how to use Python.</p>
<p>So, what we want to achieve is the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Hide some complexity from the user—especially the fact that we use Python and the HTTP server that’s built-in into Python</p></li>
<li><p>Package Python3.7 executable with all its dependencies and all static files primarily available in our project directory</p></li>
<li><p>Provide some defaults to run the server on port 80</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With all these requirements, our Dockerfile could take the following form:</p>
<div class="highlight-docker notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c"># Let&#39;s define base image.</span>
<span class="c"># &quot;python&quot; is official Python image.</span>

<div class="section" id="running-containers">
<h5>2.3.2.3. Running containers<a class="headerlink" href="#running-containers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Before your container can be started, you’ll first need to build an image defined in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Dockerfile</span></code>. You can build the image using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>docker build -t &lt;name&gt; &lt;path&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-t</span> <span class="pre">&lt;name&gt;</span></code> argument allows us to name the image with a readable identifier. It is
totally optional, but without it you won’t be able to easily reference a newly created image.
The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;path&gt;</span></code> argument specifies the path to the directory where your Dockerfile is located.
Let’s assume that we were already running the command from the root of the project we
presented in the previous section, and we want to tag our image with the name
webserver. The docker build command invocation will be following, and its output
may be as follows:</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The 143 MB of image for a simple Python image may seem like a lot, but it
isn’t really anything to worry about. For the sake of brevity, we have used
a base image that is simple to use. There are other images that have been
crafted specially to minimize this size, but these are usually dedicated to
more experienced Docker users. Also, thanks to the layered structure of
Docker images, if you’re using many containers, the base layers can be
cached and reused, so an eventual space overhead is rarely an issue.</p>
</div>
<p>Once your image is built and tagged, you can run a container using the docker run
command. Our container is an example of a web service, so we will have to additionally tell
Docker that we want to publish the container’s ports by binding them locally:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>docker run -it --rm -p <span class="m">80</span>:80 webserver
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here is an explanation of the specific arguments of the preceding command:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-it</span></code>: These are actually two concatenated options: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-i</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-t</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-i</span></code> (like interactive) keeps STDIN open, even if the container process is detached, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-t</span></code> (like tty) allocates pseudo-TTY for the container. In short, thanks to these two options, we will be able to see live logs from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http.server</span></code> and ensure that the keyboard interrupt will cause the process to exit. It will simply behave the same way as we would start Python, straight from the command line.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--rm</span></code>: Tells Docker to automatically remove container when it exits.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-p</span> <span class="pre">80:80</span></code>: Tells Docker to publish the container’s port 80 by binding port 80 on the host’s interface.</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>2.3.2.4. Setting up complex environments<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-complex-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>While the basic usage of Docker is pretty straightforward for basic setups, it can be bit
overwhelming once you start to use it in multiple projects. It is really easy to forget about
specific command-line options, or which ports should be published on which images. But
things start to be really complicated when you have one service that needs to communicate
with others. Single docker containers should only contain one running process.</p>
<p>This means that you really shouldn’t put any additional process supervision tools, such as
Supervisor and Circus, and should instead set up multiple containers that communicate
with each other. Each service may use a completely different image, provide different
configuration options, and expose ports that may or may not overlap.</p>
<p>The best tool that you can use in both simple and complex scenarios is Compose. Compose
is usually distributed with Docker, but in some Linux distributions (for example, Ubuntu),
it may not be available by default, and must be installed as a separate package from the

and allows you to describe multi-container applications using the YAML syntax.</p>
<p>Compose expects the specially named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></code> file to be in your project

<h5>2.3.2.5. Reducing the size of containers<a class="headerlink" href="#reducing-the-size-of-containers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>A common concern of new Docker users is the size of their container images. It’s true that
containers provide a lot of space overhead compared to plain Python packages, but it is
usually nothing if we compare the size of images for virtual machines. However, it is still
very common to host many services on a single virtual machine, but with a container-based
approach, you should definitely have a separate image for every service. This means that
with a lot of services, the overhead may become noticeable.</p>
<p>If you want to limit the size of your images, you can use two complementary techniques:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Use a base image that is designed specifically for that purpose: Alpine Linux is an example of a compact Linux distribution that is specifically tailored to provide very small and lightweight Docker images. The base image is only 5 MB in size, and provides an elegant package manager that allows you to keep your images compact, too.</p></li>
<li><p>Take into consideration the characteristics of the Docker overlay filesystem: Docker images consist of layers where each layer encapsulates the difference in the root filesystem between itself and the previous layer. Once the layer is committed the size of the image cannot be reduced. This means that if you need a system package as a build dependency, and it may be later discarded from the image, then instead of using multiple RUN instructions, it may be better to do everything in a single RUN instruction with chained shell commands to avoid excessive layer commits.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These two techniques can be illustrated by the following Dockerfile:</p>
<div class="highlight-docker notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c"># Here we use bare alpine to illustrate</span>
<span class="c"># package management as it lacks Python</span>
<span class="c"># by default. For Python projects in general</span>
<span class="c"># the &#39;python:3.7-alpine&#39; is probably better</span>
<span class="c"># choice.</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="s">alpine:3.7</span>

<span class="c"># Add python3 package as alpine image lacks it by default</span>
<span class="k">RUN</span> apk add python3

<span class="c"># Run multiple commands in single RUN instruction</span>
<span class="c"># so space can be reclaimed after the &#39;apk del py3-pip&#39;</span>
<span class="c"># command because image layer is committed only after</span>
<span class="c"># whole whole instruction.</span>

<h5>2.3.2.6. Addressing services inside of a Compose environment<a class="headerlink" href="#addressing-services-inside-of-a-compose-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Complex applications often consist of multiple services that communicate with each other.
Compose allows us to define such applications with ease. The following is an example
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></code> file that defines the application as a composition of two services:</p>
<div class="highlight-yaml notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">version</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;3&#39;</span>
<span class="nt">services</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nt">webserver</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="nt">build</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">.</span>
        <span class="nt">ports</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&quot;80:80&quot;</span>
        <span class="nt">tty</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">true</span>

    <span class="nt">database</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="nt">image</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">postgres</span>
        <span class="nt">restart</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">always</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The preceding configuration defines two services:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">webserver</span></code>: This is a main application service container with images built from the local Dockerfile</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database</span></code>: This is a PostgreSQL database container from an official postgres Docker image</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We assume that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">webserver</span></code> service wants to communicate with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database</span></code> service
over the network. In order to set up such communications, we need to know the service IP
address or hostname so that it can be used as an application configuration. Thankfully,
Compose is a tool that was designed exactly for such scenarios, so it will make it a lot more
easier for us.</p>
<p>Whenever you start your environment with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docker-compose</span> <span class="pre">up</span></code> command, Compose
will create a dedicated Docker network by default, and will register all services in that
network using their names as their hostnames. This means that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">webserver</span></code> service can
use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database:5432</span></code> address to communicate with its database (5432 is the default
PostgreSQL port), and any other service in that Compose applicant will be able to access
the HTTP endpoint of the webserver service under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://webserver:80</span></code> address.</p>
<p>Even though the service hostnames in Compose are easily predictable, it isn’t good practice
to hardcode any addresses in your application or its configuration. The best approach
would be to provide them as environment variables that can be read by an application on
startup. The following example shows how arbitrary environment variables can be defined
for each service in a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight-yaml notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">version</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;3&#39;</span>

<h5>2.3.2.7. Communicating between multiple Compose environments<a class="headerlink" href="#communicating-between-multiple-compose-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If you build a system composed of multiple independent services and/or applications, you
will very likely want to keep their code in multiple independent code repositories
(projects). The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></code> files for every Compose application are usually kept
in the same code repository as the application code. The default network that was created
by Compose for a single application is isolated from the networks of other applications. So,
what can you do if you suddenly want your multiple independent applications to
communicate with each other?</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is another thing that is extremely easy with Compose. The syntax of
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></code> file allows you to define a named external Docker network as
the default network for all services defined in that configuration. The following is an
example configuration that defines an external network named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">my-interservicenetwork</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-yaml notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">version</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;3&#39;</span>

<span class="nt">networks</span><span class="p">:</span>

     <span class="nt">webserver</span><span class="p">:</span>
         <span class="nt">build</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">.</span>
         <span class="nt">ports</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&quot;80:80&quot;</span>
         <span class="nt">tty</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">true</span>
         <span class="nt">environment</span><span class="p">:</span>
             <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">DATABASE_HOSTNAME=database</span>
             <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">DATABASE_PORT=5432</span>

     <span class="nt">database</span><span class="p">:</span>
         <span class="nt">image</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">postgres</span>
         <span class="nt">restart</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">always</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Such external networks are not managed by Compose, so you’ll have to create it manually
with the docker network create command, as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>docker network create my-interservice-network
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once you have done this, you can use this external network in other <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></code>
files for all applications that should have their services registered in the same network. The
following is an example configuration for other applications that will be able to
communicate with both <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">webserver</span></code> services over <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">my-interservicenetwork</span></code>, even though
they are not defined in the same <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></code> file:</p>

<h2>3. Popular productivity tools<a class="headerlink" href="#popular-productivity-tools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Productivity tool is bit of a vague term. On one hand, almost every open source code
package that has been released and is available online is a kind of productivity booster: it
provides ready-to-use solutions to some problem, so that no one needs to spend time on it
(ideally speaking). On the other hand, you could say that the whole of Python is about
productivity, and both are undoubtedly true. Almost everything in this language and
community surrounding it seems to be designed in order to make software development as
productive as possible.</p>
<p>This creates a positive feedback loop. Since writing code is fun and easy, a lot of
programmers use their free time to create tools that make it even easier and fun. And this
fact will be used here as a basis for a very subjective and non-scientific definition of a
productivity tool: a piece of software that makes development easier and more fun.</p>
<p>By nature, productivity tools focus mainly on certain elements of the development process,
such as testing, debugging, and managing packages, and are not core parts of products that
they help to build. In some cases, they may not even be referred to anywhere in the project’s
codebase, despite being used on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The most important productivity tools, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">venv</span></code>, were already discussed earlier.
Some of them have packages for specific problems, such as profiling and testing,
which have their own chapters in this book. This section is dedicated to other tools that are
really worth mentioning, but have no specific chapter in this book where they could be
introduced.</p>

<h3>3.1. Custom Python shells<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-python-shells" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Python programmers spend a lot of time in interactive interpreter sessions. It is very good
for testing small code snippets, accessing documentation, or even debugging code at
runtime. The default interactive Python session is very simple, and does not provide many
features, such as tab completion or code introspection helpers. Fortunately, the default
Python shell can be easily extended and customized.</p>
<p>If you use an interactive shell very often, you can easily modify the behavior of it prompt.
Python at startup reads the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PYTHONSTARTUP</span></code> environment variable, looking for the path of
the custom initializations script. Some operating system distributions where Python is a
common system component (for example, Linux, macOS) may be already preconfigured to
provide a default startup script. It is commonly found in the users, home directory under
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.pythonstartup</span></code> name. These scripts often use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">readline</span></code> module (based on the
GNU readline library) together with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rlcompleter</span></code> in order to provide interactive tab
completion and command history.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a default python startup script, you can easily build your own. A basic
script for command history and tab completion can be as simple as the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">atexit</span>

<p>Create this file in your home directory and call it <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.pythonstartup</span></code>. Then, add

<h4>3.1.1. Setting up the PYTHONSTARTUP environment variable<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-the-pythonstartup-environment-variable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you are running Linux or macOS, the simplest way is to create the startup script in your
home folder. Then, link it with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PYTHONSTARTUP</span></code> environment variable that’s been set in
the system shell startup script. For example, Bash and Korn shell use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.profile</span></code> file,
where you can insert a line, as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">PYTHONSTARTUP</span><span class="o">=</span>~/.pythonstartup
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you are running Windows, it is easy to set a new environment variable as an
administrator in the system preferences, and save the script in a common place instead of
using a specific user location.</p>
<p>Writing on the PYTHONSTARTUP script may be a good exercise, but creating a good custom
shell all alone is a challenge that only a few can find time for. Fortunately, there are a few
custom Python shell implementations that immensely improve the experience of interactive
sessions in Python.</p>

<h3>3.2. Incorporating shells in your own scripts and programs<a class="headerlink" href="#incorporating-shells-in-your-own-scripts-and-programs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, there is a need to incorporate a read-eval-print loop (REPL), similar to Python’s
interactive session, inside of your own software. This allows for easier experimentation
with your code and inspection of its internal state. The simplest module that allows for
emulating Python’s interactive interpreter already comes with the standard library and is
named code.</p>
<p>The script that starts interactive sessions consists of one import and single function call:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">code</span>
<span class="n">code</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">interact</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can easily do some minor tuning, such as modify a prompt value or add banner and
exit messages, but anything more fancy will require a lot more work. If you want to have
more features, such as code highlighting, completion, or direct access to the system shell, it
is always better to use something that was already built by someone. Fortunately, all of the
interactive shells that were mentioned in the previous section can be embedded in your
own program as easily as the code module.</p>
<p>The following are examples of how to invoke all of the previously mentioned shells inside
of your code:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">IPython</span>
<span class="n">IPython</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">embed</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">bpython</span>
<span class="n">bpython</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">embed</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">ptpython.repl</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">embed</span>
<span class="n">embed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">globals</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="nb">locals</span><span class="p">())</span>

<h3>3.3. Interactive debuggers<a class="headerlink" href="#interactive-debuggers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Code debugging is an integral element of the software development process. Many
programmers can spend most of their life using only extensive logging
and print statements as their primary debugging tools, but most professional developers
prefer to rely on some kind of debugger.</p>
<p>Python already ships with a built-in interactive debugger called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code> (refer
to <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html</a>). It can be invoked from
the command line on the existing script, so Python will enter post-mortem debugging if the program exits
abnormally:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">python</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">pdb</span> <span class="n">script</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Post-mortem debugging, while useful, does not cover every scenario. It is useful only when
the application exits with some exception if the bug occurs. In many cases, faulty code just
behaves abnormally, but does not exit unexpectedly. In such cases, custom breakpoints can
be set on a specific line of code using this single-line idiom:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pdb</span>
<span class="n">pdb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_trace</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will cause the Python interpreter to start the debugger session on this line during
runtime.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code> is very useful for tracing issues, and at first glance it may look very familiar to the wellknown
GNU Debugger (GDB). Because Python is a dynamic language, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code> session is
very similar to an ordinary interpreter session. This means that the developer is not limited
to tracing code execution, but can call any code and even perform module imports.</p>
<p>Sadly, because of its roots (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bdb</span></code>), your first experience with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code> can be a bit overwhelming
due to the existence of cryptic short-letter debugger commands such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">h</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">n</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">j</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code>.
When in doubt, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">help</span> <span class="pre">pdb</span></code> command which can be typed during the debugger session,
will provide extensive usage and additional information.</p>
<p>The debugger session in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdb</span></code> is also very simple and does not provide additional features
such as tab completion or code highlighting. Fortunately, there are a few packages available
on PyPI that provide such features from alternative Python shells, as mentioned in the
previous section. The most notable examples are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ipdb</span></code>: This is a separate package based on ipython</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ptpdb</span></code>: This is a separate package based on ptpython</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bpdb</span></code>: This is bundled with bpython</p></li>
</ul>
