Container objects
=================

Python provides a good selection of built-in data containers that allow you to efficiently
solve many problems if you choose them wisely. Types that you should already know of
are those that have dedicated literals:

- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets

Python is, of course, not limited to these four containers, and it extends the list of possible
choices through its standard library. In many cases, solutions to some problems may be as
simple as making a good choice for the data structure to hold your data.
