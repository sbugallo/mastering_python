Naming

Most of the standard library was built keeping usability in mind. Python, in this case, can
be compared to the pseudocode you might think about when working on a program. Most
of the code can be read out loud. For instance, this snippet could be understood even by
someone that is not a programmer:

.. code-block:: python

    my_list = []
    if 'd' not in my_list:
        my_list.append('d')

The fact that Python code is so close to natural language is one of the reasons why Python is
so easy to learn and use. When you are writing a program, the flow of your thoughts is
quickly translated into lines of code.
