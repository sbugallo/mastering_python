Clean architecture
==================

In this final chapter, we focus on how everything fits together in the design of a whole
system. This is a more theoretical chapter. Given the nature of the topic, it would be too
complex to delve down into the more low-level details. Besides, the point is precisely to
escape from those details, assume that all the principles explored in previous chapters are
assimilated, and focus on the design of a system at scale.
